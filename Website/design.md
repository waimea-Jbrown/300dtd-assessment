# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Online Multi User Calendar**

Project Author: **Joshua Brown**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

The problem with trying to spend time with people in today's time is that nobody has the time to do so that leaves other people struggling to find other alternatives to do and it can sometimes be annoying setting up a trip or something around that kind of experience and they cant get out of work and they needed notice but you didn't know what days he was working 

### End-User Requirements

Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements.

The end users would need to have a calendar that they would need to find it easy to use and navigate the end user would also have a specific login that they can create and share a calendar with another user and only the admin and people they share with can see that specific calendar so it keeps it safe and private 

### Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.


-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Implications

### Privacy

the relevant implication privacy is the idea of the data collected will only be seen by people that the user allows 

the way that privacy will fit in with this application is only admins and other people that the user shares the certain calendar will be able to see what contains in their private calendar

there will have to be certain precautions taken for example doing regular checks of peoples calendars by admins in case of people that are trying to use the calendar to cause harm to other people e.g who people might get bullied that day


### usability

the relevant implication usability is the idea that the application will be easy to navigate with little to no inconsistencies with design and have good error prevention 

the way that usability will fit in with this application is most of the areas that are specific to using colour or that are colour coded will not be different in any way to keep the user feel that the application is easy to navigate as well as if an error occurs there will be a clear message stating what went wrong

there will have to be certain precautions taken for example doing regular checks of peoples calendars by admins in case of people that are trying to use the calendar to cause harm to other people e.g who people might get bullied that day

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.

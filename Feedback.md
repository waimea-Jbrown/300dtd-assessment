# Teacher Feedback on Documentation and Other Evidence

> Josh, you are a little behind where you need to be. Get it sorted ASAP, otherwise you'll never catch up - you should be well into designing stuff now.

> Your documentation suffers from a few grammatical things that you really ought to put right:
> - Lack of capital letters at start of sentences
> - lack of punctuation (full-stops, etc.)

> If you have trouble with this kind of thing, then get someone at home, or a mate, to look over it for you. Only takes a few minutes.


## System Requirements	

- [x] **A** Purpose of outcome identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [ ] **A** End-users identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [ ] **A** Key functionality that satisfies the purpose and end-user requirements identified
- [ ] **A** Implications, relevant to purpose and end-users, are described and linked to design of outcome
- [ ] **M** UX design principles, relevant to purpose, identified, described and linked to design of outcome

> Your problem description could do with a little bit of work: spelling, punctuation, paragraphs, etc. Get someone to read over it for you if you can.

> End users - see the exemplar for what should go here. It's not what they will do, but who they are, and what needs they may have

> Solution / functionality - not done

> Implications - Started, but only two... Functionality? Aesthetics? End-Users?

> UX - Not done


## Database Structure	

- [ ] **A** Structure of the database is designed (tables, fields, data types, primary keys, relationships, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Structure of the database is logical (i.e. DB is normalised, tables / fields are named logically, etc.)

## Front-End UI Designs

- [ ] **A** Design for key web pages have been sketched out with supporting notes, etc.
- [ ] **E** Design ideas for website are detailed.
- [ ] **E** Design takes into account input from the end users
- [ ] **E** Selection of design features with justification related to requirements / UX principles

## System Testing

### Database Testing

- [ ] **A** Database queries have been tested to ensure that they obtain the required data. Documented evidence of this

> Comments...  

### Functionality Testing

- [ ] **A** Functionality has been tested and there is evidence for this (screenshots, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Testing is thorough (all functionality covered)

> Comments...  

### Code Testing

- [ ] **M** Code (HTML and CSS) validates. Documented evidence for this

> Comments...  

### UX / Usability Testing

- [ ] **M** Relevant UX design principles have been applied and evaluated
- [ ] **E** UX design principles systematically applied and evaluated

> Comments...  

## Improvements Based on Testing

- [ ] **M** Info. from testing has been used to improve the outcome
    - [ ] End-user feedback has been used to improve the system
    - [ ] Evaluation of UX principles have been used to improve the system

### Iterative Improvements

- [ ] **E** Evidence of a series of planned, iterative design-test-improve cycles (at least three) used to refine one or more aspects of outcome
    - [ ] Interaction / UX has been iterated
    - [ ] Design of the UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented functionality has been iterated

## Review and Evaluation

- [ ] **A** Discussion of how the relevant implications were addressed in the implementation of the outcome
- [ ] **A** Discussion of how UX design principles were addressed in the implementation of the outcome
